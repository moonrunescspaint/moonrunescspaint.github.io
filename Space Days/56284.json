They discover a shocking fate of a group of scientists that was sent just decades before them and meet amazing characters such as Edward Morbius and that goofy robot Robby. \n\nBut the star of the show and the stealer of the spotlight, Altaira Morbius, played by none other than Anne Francis. There's nothing that will deter you from getting to gaze upon Altaira with her beautiful white dress and stunning crimson red jewelry in that introduction scene.

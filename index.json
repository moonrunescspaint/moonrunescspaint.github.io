I've changed it majorly once, but never touched it after that, until NOW!\n\nNow that I have the outlet; Allow me to [u]announce a few things:[/u]\n\n[b]>>[/b] This website is made with the helping hand of [b]Grant Gryczan[/b], owner of MSPFA and creator of FileGarden (Of which all images you see is hosted on)\n\nWithout his helpful contribution, none of this would exist in the timely manner in which it is now. He has taught me alot about coding (and still does because im genuinely stupid).\n\nOther contributors is [b]Seymour Schlong[/b], Creator of tools such as [background=#007e9e][url='splashtagmaker.com']Splashtag Maker[/url][/background] and other various projects posted on his [background=#007e9e][url='https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:u6d3d2a3bvfbtd2qmxafmw37']BlueSky[/url][/background]\n\n[b]>> [u]NEW STORY ADDDED:[/u] [color=#ff0059]Hearts & Minds[/color][/b] - By Opsenheimer\n\n'A story focusing on two European adults who decide to play an online game with their other friends. Both strange to the world and eachother, will they be able to connect with others to overcome the dangers ahead?\n\nA Fan Adventure focusing on action, adventure and relationships.'\n\n[b]>>[/b] I will soon be implimenting an anonymous comment system, similar to the likes of 4chan. I plan in the further future to make a board like page within CSPA that will allow general homestuck talk as well. Due to the high restrictions of discussing Homestuck on /co/.\n\nThats all I have to say for now!\n\n- Moonrunes"

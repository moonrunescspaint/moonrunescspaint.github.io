Because of this, we're not going to give the reader the satisfaction of giving you such a horrible insulting and derogatory nickname on your Placronym. That's a tired joke and frankly, not one that you are very fond of.  \n\nYou're considered a \"low-blood\" on the [size=14][b]HEMOSPECTRUM[/b][/size] for someone in your society.

The craft of taking wood and shaping it down to your artistic desires is something of a skillful trade. You've been doing this since you gained sentience... and [b]ARMS[/b]. Your main choice of wood to work with is the strong and sturdy [b][size=14]OAK WOOD[/size][/b]. You find that it is soft enough to carve with relative ease, and strong enough to keep figure after sweeps of wear and tear. You used it to build the [b][size=14]HIVE[/size][/b] that you're currently standing in!\n\nRegardless of your comfy living situation, you are what a lot would consider a [size=14][b]CRY-GRUB[/b][/size]. Always in tears at the most trivial of inconveniences. The only one who calls you this however is your only friend on [size=14][b]TROLLIAN[/b][/size]. A fairly new communication application on your husktop.\n\nSpeaking of which you should probably troll him now. He worries you sick being cooped up all by himself in that little prison cell of a respiteblock as he so describes it.

The smell of fresh dew and moist dirt surrounds you. It's a very natural clean scent and you feel lucky enough to be able to experience the senses around you in total isolation.\n\nYou've never been able to escape the veil that is the trunks of these trees. You don't know if there's an end to it in the first place. The woods stretch miles in every direction. Trying to reach the edge would seem like an impossible task.

You're not one for gore in any capacity; Not even the sight of a simple scratch. What could it mean? Is there a meaning to it? \n\nMaybe you're just still shaken up by Mallum yelling at you for not sending him the file like you promised. But you don't think you could become that anxious about it. Whatever it was, you don't like it and would prefer to never see it again if you could help it. \n\nIt's gotten colder out and the fog is starting to become more and more dense.

You also feel the slight rhythmic sway of someone underneath you moving to the music. This someone just so happens to be your Matesprite. You two have been together for a few sweeps now and are still madly in love.\n\nYou find comfort in lying next to him. Trolls treat him like royalty for some odd reason, but it's not hard to see why. He's an amazing guy with tons of personality and love in his Blood-pusher. At least you seem to think so.\n\nThat being said... What's his name again?\n\n<audio src=\"https://file.garden/ZXENUjtcLzaPWMyp/dmarko%20intro/Amber%20-%20311.mp3\" autoplay loop></audio>",

You don't really give a fuck about the wack ass problems that don't warrant the unneeded energy, shits just not that serious if you catch his drift, yo. Other than that, there's not much to really say about him. You just gotta hang and smoke up this dope with him in order to understand the vibes he gives off, ya heard?\n\nYou have quite a few interests you do like to indulge yourself with, however. On one hand you do enjoy [b]VINTAGE VHS[/b]; The hum buzz of static against a CRT screen is a pretty nostalgic feelin'. You don't really have a particular cinematic preference. Whatever you can find on VHS you'll watch it, and most of the time you vibe it anyway.\n\nYou also have a fascination with collecting PLAYBOY MAGAZINES. You collect them purely for the sake of having a collection, although indulging from time to time is not so bad. Sadly, these bitches just aint for you, you prefer bitches with muscle and huge bulges. I'll let you guess which one my fine ass matesprit got. (Its both.)\n\nTrolls all over treat you with mad respect. It's chill bein' able to walk down the strip with others adorning you with gifts and with flattering platitudes. You don't really understand why they do it, but you suppose its 'cause you're just chill like that.\n\nAs of now you're just chillin in the crib listening to music. That is to say JUNICE'S CRIB. Whatever a crib is.\n\nWhat will you do?\n",

      "b": "[img]https://file.garden/ZXENUjtcLzaPWMyp/ACT%203/0099.gif[/img]\n\nThe difference between Neorxleas and Alternia has to do with its creation. Alternia never had an explanation for its creation other than the powers that be Andrew Hussie. Neorxleas, like all planets, was created when God had set the stars in the sky on the fourth day of creation. In the midst of space, it was a husk of a planet. Not yet teaming with the vegetation and life that it has now.\n\nIn the Book of Emergence, it explains how one-third of the angels had separated from the light of God to become a power of their own. They created life on Neorxleas in their image, just like how humans were made to be in God's image. [url=https://mspfa.com/?s=54371&p=181]Renity has already explained this.[/url].\n\nSo what other differences are there apart from it essentially being Bible fanfiction? Not much. Neorxleas and Alternia are pretty much one in the same apart from its Monarchy system with Fuschias and how its Hemospectrum works.\n\nThat segways into our next question.",

      "b": "[img]https://file.garden/ZXENUjtcLzaPWMyp/ACT%203/juniceblood.gif[/img]\n\nI have already answered this question on Tumblr.\n\nTo make it short; Junice's blood color is what is known as \"Pacific Blue\". Pacific Blue is a subcaste under the Cerulean Caste System.\n\nIn Neorxleas, trolls were able to reproduce sexually with one another rather than using the Mothergrub. This practice was outlawed under Monarchal rule some time ago, but the remnants still show. Its more common to see these hybrid subclass blood colors as opposed to the Purer Hued Castes such as Rust to Fuschia. \n\nSubclasses generally are a very tedious topic, and categorization is something that's even more tedious. Since not one Blood is the same, excluding direct lineage, Classifying would be nigh impossible. So each blood caste usually has typically 5-10 Subclasses, all of which have their own hierarchy. \n\nThose of richer hues are usually seen as higher class within their caste. Those with brighter colored blood are more looked down upon and likely to be confused with Mutants.  \n\nBut those who lack hues, are typically killed off in the Caverns or die anyway due to very short lifespans.",

However, during that time oppression of the lower castes and those of theological beliefs would be persecuted more and more as time went on. \n\nBelieving in the Sheol would be downright illegal. Trolls would have to hide in secrecy and perform their cultish rituals to show their thanks to the Sheol. But trolls like the Witch pushed on and they stayed eternally bound to each other for generations upon generations. Sadly she would also be executed upon her second capture.\n\nBut that's a story for another time. Tune in next time for more Bible fanfiction!",

Total freedom and in exchange, you write a blank check to sell out the other fuchsias. Why? Cause fuck em, that’s why! That chance came and went however. The role of leader of the violets got passed over to some grub that just BARELY got control of their limbs.\nNot only blows up the earlier stated plan, admittedly, it kind of pisses you off that a grub is better at shirking off his responsibilities.

What could be better than chilling out with a corpse and snacking on its blood? Maybe hanging out with your gal pals from different castes? Those girls really know how to drag you away from any of your blood relatives, that’s for sure. \nAnd no you don’t have a group of ONLY girls because you swing that way. You’ve given dating a try, multiple times and really tried to find something serious! But the men around here are SO BORING. It’s hard to find one to have a decent conversation with, let alone keep you interested in a relationship. Honestly, the only thing they’re good at is being a 2 day bed mate before you get bored and toss his corpse in the garden. Or send him to the arena, the purples loooove dealing with your sloppy seconds.\n[/size][/justify]",

They might actually get serious for once and start looking for a culprit, ending up ruining your day and the party.

I decided to get rid of socials, didn't want to keep around the internet for a good while, it did not bother me that much, but gosh darn it bit me in the ass alot to think i was leaving this comic as well. So i decided to continue it.\n\nWill i come back to socials? Hell no, especially with their current state lol, so don't expect any nsfw comeback. The only nsfw you will see from me is in this comic, and it will be mostly pinup stuff and just vanilla nudity or something, not gonna see any straight up banging in here that is for sure! I actually want to explore more fights and more cool stuff! That will be my New years resolution so expect that as well! I don't want this comic to just being talked about the sexy ladies i wanna get some good ol hype going, that'll be a fun challenge.\n\nMAYBE, a solid maybe, i could make a social media for just the adventure in the future as sort of keep myself in touch with the readers and show doodles, i like doodles. But thats like a slim chance. BUT what i will leave here will be an email [b][color=#93ff53](drinkingproblemmspfa@gmail.com)[/color][/b]. In case if any of you makes like fanart of the adventure and wanted to show me, or wanted to leave a message or contact me that it's not the comment section in the site. [color=#ffffff]DON'T ASK ME FOR COMMISSION, i'll tell you right here and now i WON'T take any, so don't even bother. \n[/color]\nWelp, that is all i had to say me thinks. The only thing left for me to do is to thank all of you, that sticked around for a possible comback of this fandaventure, it means alot. a whole lot. So i wish for all of you a start for a Good year! \n\nPs:.\nWell shit i just saw the prices for graphics cards went up to 5k. Damn\n\nPps:.\nJust realized tha page number of this, eh, nice.[/left]",

Better yet, you can MAKE someone grab you exactly what you need! There’s gotta be something worth putting on somewhere around the hive. You’ve stripped and tossed clothes all over the place after a night out. Ya know, feels good to just be free after having to be social for so long and who doesn’t mind being half naked in their own hive?![/size][/center]",

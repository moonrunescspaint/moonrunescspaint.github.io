He and his allies challenge the fake world they were forced to participate in and face the truth, ugly as it may be. He's also incredibly awesome-looking with a brilliant fashion sense. Using many Kind Abstratus, he wipes the floor with numerous foes. His Fistkind is the most impressive. Mother let you choose this poster on your own.\n\nThe final one is a poster of \"The Family\". You don't care for this Family so you hide it but Mother insisted on having it up. It's to remind you that family is everything. Blood is thicker than water. You definitely value family above most things so the poster does its job well.\n\nThese make the pillars of your very being.

The story starts on her first birthday. Despite her very young age she shows signs of being very intelligent and very capable. One might assume its because she's often left in the company of her older brother but Tyrell isn't much of a teacher nor especially smart. Perhaps its simply genetics. The Raymond Bloodline is rumoured to be very strong so its possible that strength manifested in her mind rather than her muscles? A lot of speculation for someone as young as her.\n\nStill, she is just a baby. Cute and cuddly and loves her family very much. She remains unaware of the role she will play in the lives of many people going forward.[/size]",

A high intellect and a natural beauty form a deadly combination though not many would have the (mis)fortune of encountering it. Vanessa studies mostly from home. Home is where the heart is and her heart is very happy confined to these four walls. Especially after all the decorating and rearranging she's done over the years; One of the many perks of the affluent lifestyle. This is [i]her[/i] space. \n\nAffluent but relatively modest with her fashion choices. Black is the colour of the day and everyday. One simply cannot be grimdark without the \"dark\" can they? The use of purple add some much needed colour to her outfits. Today's accessory is the Purple Butterfly Chocker. It works like a trademark for the Bouquet family. She is grimdark. She wears a monarch butterfly. Grimdark. Monarch.\n\nDespite her looks and conduct Vanessa is simply a civilian. Not special in the slightest, minus her visions into the future, but otherwise just an ordinary person with extraordinary interests. She could go on and on about herself but she soon realises that she is still alone and expositing to nobody but herself. Now her attention turns to find a new way to pass the time.[/left]",

Vanessa can't help but admire such paradoxical beings as she contemplates their existance. All are born from myth and legend. Surely there must be some truth to them right? Regardless, it brings some comfort to have their many eyes on her whilst she works, studies and sleeps. In conclusion, this is a very normal bedroom wall.[/left]",

He props himself upon the grimdark monarch's head. This doesn't bother her. In fact, she welcomes his company. Technically he's a wild animal: A free bird if you will. Today he's using his freedom to spend time with Vanessa. This makes her happy.\n\n[color=#8000ff]\"Finally decided to come over Ray?\"[/color] She asks the bird atop her head.\n[color=#8000ff]You know the cage is just for appearances right? When we're alone you don't need to use it.\" [/color]\n\n\"CAWWW!\" he responds firmly.\n\nRaymond the Raven or just Ray for short, is a smart corvid even for his kind. He appreciates having this space to return to after his adventures despite having to pretend to be imprisoned inside a pet cage. Ray's not a pet. He's more like an avian roommate. As a result, he pays his share of the rent with the shiny things he occasionally finds around the french streets including gemstones, jewellery, money, etc. Ray's also very adamant about protecting this space from any and all intruders. Truly a mutually beneficial relationship.\n[/left]",

A mother and son doing some sort of ritual to gain approval? You suppose that not all rituals involve magical books and floating candles and ancient beings. But those are the prefered kind so if this is what Burbs is about then you'd rather not get involved. You can't form a fist with nails as amazing as yours.\nAnd you bruise easily.\nAnd you're not very fit.\n\nAs you continue down this spiral of self-deprecation, you stare at the young man.

A young man fighting his mother is what TirelessPugilist said he was going to do. You've known TirelessPugilist as \"Ty\" which is like Tyrell. Plus, you're supposed to be in Overseer mode to oversee TP's activity on the server. Therefore...\n\nThis is Tireless Pugilist. This is Tyrell. This is your friend fighting hard and Burbs is showing you all of his movements. And he's in danger just like the Ancient One said.",

You used your trump card, your inherited gift from past fighters, you saw the attack coming and still got decimated by it.\nIt was all for nothing. You pushed your body hard and steeled your mind for what feels like the inevitable outcome. Now you lay broken, bruised, bloody. Unable to move. Barely able to see.\n[spoiler open=\"Show Dia-log\" close=\"Hide\"]\n[color=#c40062][background=#c0c0c0]\nMother: Oops! I was so excited I forgot to hold back on that one!\nMother: Oh well! Guess we're gonna fast track this part.\nMother: Hope the ancestors aren't mad at me for doing things a little wrong here.\nMother: *Sigh*\n[size=12]Mother: It doesn't feel so good seeing you like this Tyrell...\nMother: I got this strong to protect you and my family from any and everything.\nMother: Using that power for this just... feels off...[/size]\n[size=10]Mother: That's why parents don't usually test their own kids for this type of thing.\nMother: Neighbours would call child protective services if they knew.[/size]\n\n[size=9]Mother: Right.

You can no longer hear your mother's words. You cannot hear anything right now. Just your thoughts or rather whats left of your conscious mind.\n\nTyrell Raymond, son of Tyressa Raymond, spent a decade learning to fight so he could be acknowledged by Those Who Came before, to receive their blessings to protect Those Who Are Present. And at the every end you're given the impossible task of defeating your mother? The Matriach of the Raymond family? She's incredibly powerful to an inhuman degree. You didn't inherit any of that power so what could you have realistically done? The cards were against you from the start so it's okay to lose here...right?\n\nYou're nothing special anyways. Sure, you are a hard worker but you have no innate affinity towards anything. That's why you learned Boxing. Besides your national trait of being skilled with a dagger, Without your bloodline you'd be a completely average joe. Again, you didn't inherit your mother's strength or tenacity. All you inherited were special eyes that screw up your entire body when used for a couple minutes. You were born in the wrong family. You don't have a warrior's spirit. You can't handle your ancestors' gift. You are nothing.\n\nThese thoughts upset you. You'd cry if you weren't surrendering to the force dragging you into a deep sleep. You are tired. Passing and failing didn't matter anymore. You need to sleep now.",
